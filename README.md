# [`realsense` module](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/realsense)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/viam-modules/viam-camera-realsense/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/viam-modules/viam-camera-realsense)


This [module](https://docs.viam.com/registry/#modular-resources) implements the [`rdk:component:camera` API](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/) in a `viam:camera:realsense` model.
Configure this model on your machine to stream image and depth data from the [Intel RealSense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) family of cameras to Viam.

Navigate to the [**CONFIGURE** tab](https://docs.viam.com/build/configure/) of your [machine](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/machines/) in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
[Add `camera / realsense` to your machine](https://docs.viam.com/build/configure/#components).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [Configure a Machine](https://docs.viam.com/manage/configuration/).

## Configure your `realsense` camera

### Configure with discovery service

1. On the [**CONFIGURE** tab](https://docs.viam.com/build/configure/), add the ** discovery / realsense:discovery ** service.
1. Save your configuration.
1. Click on the **TEST** panel for your discovery service.
   You should now see possible configurations.
1. Click **Add component** next to the configuration for your camera.

### Configure manually

Copy and paste the following attributes into your camera's JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "sensors": ["color", "depth"],
  "width_px": 640,
  "height_px": 480,
  "little_endian_depth": false,
  "serial_number": ""
}
```

Edit the attributes as applicable.

### Attributes

The following attributes are available for `viam:camera:realsense` cameras:

| Name | Type | Inclusion | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `sensors` | list | Optional | The RealSense data streams you want your robot to sense from. A list that contain the strings `color` and/or `depth`. The sensor that comes first in the list is designated the "main sensor", and is the image that gets returned by `get_image` calls and appears in the **CONTROL** tab on the [Viam app](https://app.viam.com). If you would like a list of images from all listed sensors simultaneously, use [`GetImages`](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#getimages).  |
| `width_px` | int | Optional | The width of the output images in pixels. If the RealSense cannot produce the requested resolution, the component will fail to be built. |
| `height_px` | int | Optional | The height of the output images in pixels. If the RealSense cannot produce the requested resolution, the component will fail to be built. |
| `serial_number` | string | Optional | The serial number of the specific RealSense camera to use. To find your camera's serial number, the serial number of each plugged-in and available RealSense camera will be logged on module startup. You can also find device information using the [RealSense SDK directly](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/tools/enumerate-devices/readme.md). If this field is omitted or is an empty string, the module will use the first RealSense camera it detects. |

## Example configuration:

```
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "myRealSense",
      "attributes": {
        "sensors": ["color","depth"],
        "width_px": 640,
        "height_px": 480,
        "little_endian_depth": false,
        "serial_number": "YOUR_CAMERA_SERIAL_NUMBER"
      },
      "namespace": "rdk",
      "type": "camera",
      "model": "viam:camera:realsense"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test the module

Before testing the module, make sure that your machine is connected to the Viam app, displaying as **Live** in the part status dropdown in the top right corner of the machine's page.

### Camera API

Once the `realsense` model is configured on your machine, you can access the depth and color data the camera streams through the [Viam camera API](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#api).
The following methods of the Viam camera API are supported:

- [`GetPointCloud`](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#getpointcloud): returns depth data and can return color data depending on the provided image
- [`GetImages`](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#getimages): returns image data from configured sensors, filterable via source names (see below)
- [`GetProperties`](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/#getproperties): returns intrinsic properties of a camera

#### `GetImages` source names

`GetImages` accepts an optional `filter_source_names` parameter to select which image sources to return. The valid source names are:

| Source name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `color` | RGB color image, encoded as JPEG |
| `depth` | Depth map, encoded as raw depth bytes (big-endian by default, little-endian if `little_endian_depth` is `true`) |

A source is only returned if it is **both** listed in the `sensors` attribute of the camera's configuration **and** included in `filter_source_names` (or `filter_source_names` is empty). For example:

- `sensors: ["color", "depth"]` with empty `filter_source_names` returns both `color` and `depth`.
- `sensors: ["color", "depth"]` with `filter_source_names: ["depth"]` returns only `depth`.
- `sensors: ["color"]` with empty `filter_source_names` returns only `color`, since `depth` is not configured.
- `sensors: ["color"]` with `filter_source_names: ["depth"]` returns nothing, since `depth` is not in `sensors`.

### CONTROL tab of app.viam.com

You can view the data your camera streams live on the **CONTROL** tab of the Viam app.
For more information, see [Control Machines](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/control/).

### Firmware Update

The RealSense module supports updating camera firmware through the `do_command` API. This allows you to:
- Install bug fixes and performance improvements
- Ensure consistent firmware versions across multiple devices
- Recover from firmware issues

> [!NOTE]
> Firmware update is currently supported on **Linux only**. macOS support is not yet available.

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT DISCONNECT THE CAMERA DURING A FIRMWARE UPDATE!** Interrupting the update process can brick your device.

#### Usage

Use the `do_command` method with the following command structure:

**Option 1: Auto-detect recommended firmware (recommended)**
```json
{
  "firmware_update": ""
}
```

Setting `firmware_update` to an empty string will automatically detect your camera's current firmware version and install the recommended update if available.

**Option 2: Specify firmware URL**
```json
{
  "firmware_update": "https://example.com/firmware.zip"
}
```

You can specify a direct URL to a firmware `.zip` file containing the firmware binary.

#### Supported Auto-detect Versions

The following firmware versions are supported for auto-detect mode:

| Version | Device Series | URL |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| 5.17.0.10 | D400 Series | [Download](https://realsenseai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/d400_series_production_fw_5_17_0_10.zip) |

#### Example using Python SDK

```python
from viam.components.camera import Camera

# Get the camera component
camera = Camera.from_robot(robot, "myRealSense")

# Option 1: Auto-detect and install recommended firmware
result = await camera.do_command({"firmware_update": ""})

# Option 2: Install specific firmware from URL
result = await camera.do_command({
    "firmware_update": "https://realsenseai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/d400_series_production_fw_5_17_0_10.zip"
})
```

#### Important Notes

- **⚠️ DO NOT DISCONNECT**: Never disconnect the camera during a firmware update. This can permanently damage the device.
- **Firmware format**: Only `.zip` files containing firmware binaries are supported.
- **Single camera updates**: Only update one camera at a time. If you have multiple RealSense cameras, perform updates sequentially.
- **Update process**: The camera will enter DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode during the update. This is normal and may take several minutes to complete.
- **Camera unavailable during update**: The camera will not be available for streaming during the firmware update process.
- **Recovery mode support**: The Discovery service automatically detects cameras in recovery/DFU mode and creates them as separate camera components with a `-recovery` suffix. To update a recovery device, you must provide an explicit firmware URL (auto-detect is not supported for recovery devices).
- **One-time operation**: The firmware update is a one-time operation. Once complete, the camera will automatically reboot with the new firmware.

#### Update Process

1. Check your current firmware version by viewing the module logs on startup
2. **Ensure the camera is securely connected** and will not be disconnected during the update
3. Call `do_command` with the `firmware_update` parameter
4. Monitor the module logs to track update progress
5. Wait for the update to complete (typically 2-5 minutes)
6. The camera will automatically reboot and be ready to use with the new firmware

#### Troubleshooting Firmware Updates

##### Camera Stuck in Recovery/DFU Mode

If a firmware update is interrupted (power loss, disconnection, etc.), your camera may be stuck in recovery/DFU mode. You'll see these symptoms:

- Discovery service discovers a camera named `realsense-XXXXXXXXX-recovery` (with `-recovery` suffix)
  - **Note**: The number (`XXXXXXXXX`) is the **firmware update ID**, not the camera's serial number
  - This is a temporary identifier used while the camera is in recovery mode
- That camera cannot stream images
- Module logs show: `Device at index X is in recovery/DFU mode with update ID: XXXXXXXXX`

**To recover the camera:**

1. Use Discovery service to find the recovery device
2. Add the recovery device to your robot configuration
3. Simply run the firmware update command again on the recovery device, but this time with an explicit firmware URL:
   ```json
   {
     "firmware_update": "https://example.com/firmware.zip"
   }
   ```
4. Wait for the update to complete (100% progress)
5. The original camera will reboot and return to normal operation
6. The recovery device will no longer be found and should be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> Auto-detect mode (`"firmware_update": ""`) does not work for recovery devices. You must provide an explicit firmware URL.

##### Update Progress Stops or Hangs

If the firmware update progress stops for more than 2 minutes:

1. **DO NOT disconnect the camera** - wait at least 5 minutes
2. Check the module logs for error messages
3. If the module crashes during update or the update process is abruptly interrupted for any other reason:
   - The camera will remain in recovery mode
   - Follow the steps in the "Camera Stuck in Recovery/DFU Mode" section

##### "Access failed" or "Device may be in an invalid state"

These errors typically occur when:
- The camera is transitioning between modes (normal ↔ DFU)
- Multiple processes are trying to access the camera
- The camera needs time to enumerate after plugging in

**Solution:**
1. Wait 10-15 seconds for the camera to fully enumerate
2. Ensure only the Viam module is accessing the camera (close RealSense Viewer, other apps)
3. Try unplugging the camera for 5 seconds, then plug it back in
4. Restart the Viam module if issues persist

##### Network/Download Issues

Firmware downloads require internet connectivity. If downloads fail:

- Verify your machine can access the internet
- Check firewall settings allow HTTPS traffic
- Try downloading the firmware manually first to test connectivity:
  ```bash
  curl -O https://realsenseai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/d400_series_production_fw_5_17_0_10.zip
  ```

##### Manual Recovery Using Intel Tools

If automatic recovery fails, you can manually recover using Intel's tools, more info [here](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/tree/master/tools/fw-update)

##### General Troubleshooting Tips

- **USB Quality**: Use a high-quality USB 3.0 cable directly to a USB 3.0 port (avoid hubs)
- **Power Supply**: Ensure adequate power supply, especially on Raspberry Pi
- **One at a time**: Only update one camera at a time if you have multiple devices
- **Check logs**: Module logs provide detailed progress and error information
- **Verify device name**: A camera in recovery mode will appear with a `-recovery` suffix in its name

### Locally install the module

If you are using a Linux machine, and do not want to use the Viam registry, you can [download the module code from the registry](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/realsense) and use it directly on your machine.
Note that as of version 0.16.0-rc3, the module is no longer distributed as an AppImage.

Follow the instructions to [add a local module](https://docs.viam.com/operate/modules/support-hardware/#test-your-module-locally) just as you would for testing.
Provide an **Executable path** of `/usr/local/bin/viam-camera-realsense` when adding the module.

Or, if you aren't using the Viam app to manage your machine's configuration, modify your machine's JSON file as follows to add the `realsense` module to your machine:

```
  "modules": [
    {
      "type": "local",
      "name": "intel",
      "executable_path": "/usr/local/bin/viam-camera-realsense"
    }
  ],
```

## Known supported hardware

Support for specific hardware is known for the following devices. The table is not complete and subject to change.

| Devices               | D435 | D435i | D455 |
|-----------------------|------|-------|------|
| RPi 4B Bookworm       |  X   |       |      |
| RPi 4B Bullseye       |  X   |       |      |
| Orin Nano JetPack 5.1 |  X   |   X   |  X   |
| UP 4000               |  X   |       |      |
| macOS                 |      |  (1)  |      |

(1) macOS support is experimental and based on [v2.57.6 (Beta)](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.57.6) from RealSense. May have stability issues. Firmware updates are not supported on macOS.

## Linux distribution recommendation

This module depends on the [`librealsense` SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases). As of the time of writing, Ubuntu is the only Linux Distro `librealsense` officially supports. The module works on our hardware setups using Bullseye on RPI4, and some setups on Bookworm. However, we recommend adhering to the requirements of the SDK dependency and to use Ubuntu when possible to avoid instability and unexpected behavior.

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error like "failed to set power state", or "Permission denied", you may need to install the udev rules for when the USB plugs in.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/7a7c2bcfbc03d45154ad63fa76b221b2bb9d228f/config/99-realsense-libusb.rules
sudo cp 99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

You can also look at the official RealSense troubleshooting guide [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/Troubleshooting-Q%26A#q-i-ran-the-udev-rules-script-but-linux-still-get-permission-denied).

The module takes advantage of faster USB ports. Use the (blue) USB 3.0 port on the Raspberry Pi for faster streaming and access to more resolution options.

## macOS Distribution Recommendation

macOS support is based on [v2.57.6 (Beta)](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.57.6) from RealSense, and may have stability issues given its beta state.

**Note**: Firmware updates are not currently supported on macOS.


### Troubleshooting

If you see errors like `[serve] Realsense module is not running as root`:
- You must stop the viam-server service with ctrl-C on the terminal where it is running
- Then run it as root with `sudo viam-server -config <path-to-viam-config>.json`

## Building the module

### Setup
```
make setup
```
### Build the module tarball
```
make module.tar.gz
```

### Test the module
```

## Using within a Frame System

It is important to consider that the coordinate system of the camera might not match the coordinate system of the component it is mounted on. Let us consider the scenario where the camera is mounted on a base, such that the camera faces the forward direction of movement of the base. Let the base's forward direction be the +Y axis. Following the right hand rule, the +X axis points right, and so the +Z axis of the base points up. For the intel realsense camera the +Z axis points out of the camera lens, the +X axis points to the right, and the +Y axis points down. To properly configure these components in the frame system we say that the camera's parent is the base. We say that the orientation of the camera in Viam's Orientation Vector Degrees is OX:0, OY:1, OZ:0, Theta:-90. It is important to note that the base itself must also be in the frame system, the base would have parent as world with the default Viam Orientation Vector Degrees values, i.e. OX:0, OY:0, OZ:1, Theta:0.

For the Z offset between the exterior of the camera and the point where depth = 0, find the depth start point (ground zero reference) in the [manufacturer data sheet](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/intel-realsense-d400-series-product-family-datasheet).

Below is an image of the intel realsense's coordinate system.
